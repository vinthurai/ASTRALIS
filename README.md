# ASTRALIS: Astronomical Spectral Transmission Line Simulation 
## Monte Carlo Transmission Line Modelling of Broadband Dichroics for Astronomical Spectroscopy:
This is a tool uses transmission line modelling to evaluate the spectral performance of dichroic filters considering parameters such as coating thicknesses, refractive indices, angle of incidence and polarization. A dichroic can be designed in line with the spectral requirements of an extreme broadband dichroic. Here we provide an example of a dichroic which will be employed in the Ariel Mission as a case study. Moreover, we consider the componentâ€™s tolerance to systematics arising from manufacturing processes as well as environmental changes in space. This is significant given the need for simultaneous observations across diverse wavelength ranges driving the development of more complex dichroic filters. As these optical components become more sophisticated, the effect of uncertainties and systematics surrounding their spectral performance becomes more intricate. This provides a predictive modelling tool in order to perform a comprehensive analysis of dichroic filters and their spectral performance under various conditions and expected systematics.

## Running the code:
The main script to run is run_dichroic.py. 
The script to run the monte_carlo dichroic designed thicknesses adjustment is run_monte_carlo.py.
The configuration files within the config folder can be edited as required.
